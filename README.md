In this project from the given starter code I had to built a working Node.js command-line application.
This application will take in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generate an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

## Installation

Not required.

## Usage

When a user starts the application, they're prompted to enter the team manager's:

Name

Employee ID

Email address

Office number

When a user enters those requirements, the user is presented with a menu with the option to:

Add an engineer

Add an intern

Finish building the team

When a user selects the engineer option, the user is prompted to enter the following and then taken back to the menu:

Engineer's Name

ID

Email

GitHub username

When a user selects the intern option, the user is prompted to enter the following and then taken back to the menu:

Internâ€™s name

ID

Email

School

When a user decides to finish building their team, they exit the application and the HTML is generated.
